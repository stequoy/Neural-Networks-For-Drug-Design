# Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Energy Prediction

## Overview
This project, conducted during a summer internship as part of the course at HSE University on neural networks for drug design, focuses on using equivariant graph neural networks to predict the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) energy. The project aims to explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of equivariant graph neural networks in the field of computational chemistry and drug discovery.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the QM9 dataset, which is a well-known benchmark dataset in molecular property prediction.

## Implementation
The core implementation involves the application of equivariant graph neural networks to predict HOMO energy levels. The model is trained and evaluated on the QM9 dataset, providing insights into the molecular energy states.
